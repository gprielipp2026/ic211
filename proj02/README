# Steps Completed
1. Full submit completion (46/46)
2. Adding data (to my extent of knowledge on its behavior) functions properly
3. "Full" shift+ hashing operates as intended

# Errors
As far as I can tell, there are no errors with my implementation and it
can be extended with new Hashing and Encryption algorithms with small
changes to User and Data (a ".add(new Algorithm()" in the getHasher() or
getEncryptor() methods)
