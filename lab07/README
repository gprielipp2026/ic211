We split the Thing data and methods into its own class that provided a
public interface to interact with the Thing but not to alter its data
from the outside.

Adding new Things is easy because we separated the implementation so
inheritance can be used. 

The polymorphic call happens when we add a Thing to our LList. It
ensures we can diversify our implementations and get unique output.
